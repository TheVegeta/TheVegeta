Hey there, I'm Chauhan Harsh!

Passionate about crafting seamless web experiences with React and GraphQL. My journey as a developer revolves around translating ideas into elegant code that not only functions but also captivates users.

I'm all about the pursuit of knowledge and growth. Always up for a challenge, I'm currently diving deep into trpc and three.js to further elevate my skill set. Learning isn't just a task; it's a thrilling adventure for me.
